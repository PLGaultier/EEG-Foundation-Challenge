# EEG-Foundation-Challenge

The 2025 EEG Foundation Challenge: From Cross-Task to Cross-Subject EEG Decoding is a biosignal challenge accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Competition Track. This competition aims to advance the field of EEG decoding by addressing two critical challenges:

Cross-Task Transfer Learning: Developing models that can effectively transfer knowledge from passive EEG tasks to active tasks
Subject Invariant Representation: Creating robust representations that generalize across different subjects while predicting clinical factors

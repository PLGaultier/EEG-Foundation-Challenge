# Experiments Directory

This directory contains experiment configurations, results, and analysis.

## Structure

- `configs/` - Experiment configuration files (YAML/JSON)
- `results/` - Training results, logs, and metrics
- `checkpoints/` - Model checkpoints during training
- `analysis/` - Post-training analysis and visualization scripts

## Experiment Tracking

Consider using tools like:
- Weights & Biases (wandb)
- MLflow
- TensorBoard

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names for experiments:
- `cross_task_transfer_v1/`
- `subject_invariant_baseline/`
- `multimodal_fusion_experiment/`
